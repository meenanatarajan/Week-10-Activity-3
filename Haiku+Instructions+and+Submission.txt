What is Haiku?
Haiku is a Japanese poetry form. A Haiku uses just a few words to capture a moment and create a picture in the reader's mind. It is like a tiny window into a scene much larger than itself.

Traditionally, Haiku is written in three lines, with five syllables in the first line, seven syllables in the second line, and five syllables in the third line.

Decide what kind of Haiku you’d like to write. You can choose to follow the 5-7-5 syllable style, or decide you want to be more experimental with your structure and adjust the number of syllables. If you’re writing an English Haiku, you’ll separate your poem into three lines.
Determine your subject matter. Pay attention to small details around you. Nature themes are most common in Haiku, so start to notice things like birds or leaves outside, the way the air feels, or even a smell in the air. Many Haiku are about very simple natural elements of day-to-day life.
Use short phrases that evoke strong images. Think of how Japanese poets use kigo, and choose images that symbolize a season (say, fallen leaves for fall or daffodils for spring) to set a mood with very few words.
Use a kireji or “cutting word” to create a break in the meter. Remember to use punctuation in conjunction with a kireji to control the rhythm of the poem.

Haiku examples

1.
The last winter leaves
Clinging to the black branches
Explode into birds.

2.
An old pond!
A frog jumps in –
The sound of water.

3.
A caterpillar,
this deep in fall –
still not a butterfly.

4.
In Kyoto,
Hearing the cuckoo,
I long for Kyoto.
